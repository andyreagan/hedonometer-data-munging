Hedonometer Data Munging
==

These are some of scripts that put data in the right place, and the right format, for [hedonometer.org](http://hedonometer.org).

I've put them on github in case of a catastrophe (as in, I type `\rm *~` without the `~`, it's happened).

See [https://github.com/andyreagan/hedonometer](https://github.com/andyreagan/hedonometer) for how this fits into the whole pipeline of Hedonometer.
